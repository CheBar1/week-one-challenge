<Week One Challenge>

## Week One Challenge

This challenge involved a code refactor of an existing site to make it more accessible. 

An increasingly important consideration for businesses, web **accessibility** ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Accessibility is good for business&mdash;for one thing, accessible sites rank higher in search engines like Google.  

To ensure a webpage meets accessibility standards the following are required:
- Semantic HTML elements;
- The elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning;
- The icon and image elements have accessible alt attributes;
- The heading attributes fall in sequential order;
- The title element is concise and descriptive.
