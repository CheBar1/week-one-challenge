# Week One Challenge

## Description

This challenge involved the code refactor of an existing site to make it more accessible. 

An increasingly important consideration for businesses, web **accessibility** ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Accessibility is good for business&mdash;for one thing, accessible sites rank higher in search engines like Google.  

To make the original webpage more accessibe the code was refactored as follows:
- Div elements replaced with semantic HTML elements;
- Elements moved to follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning;
- Accessible alt attributes added for the icon and image elements;
- The heading attributes coded to fall in sequential order;
- The title element made concise and descriptive;
- The broken navigation link to the search engine optimization section fixed.
